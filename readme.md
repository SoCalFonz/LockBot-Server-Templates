# Server Setup:
Since all layouts have been extensively tested and are all with the same permission layouts, these are the most effcient ways to use the `m-mode` command and the most efficient ways to unlock the server with `m-unlock`.

### Method #1: Working with **LockBot Simple V1 & Community V1**
> Run the command and unlock **all** public chat channels with `.s-unlock`

> This command will revert everything back to how it was before it was locked.

> If any issues arrise, this is how to unlock the normal information category:
-  Right click the Information Category
- Go to Edit Category
- Permissions
- Scroll to the `@everyone` role and allow Read Text Channels and See Voice Channels

And that's it! You have successfully unlocked your server without the hassle of having to mess with so many role permissions! Once you unlock your channels you can then delete the `#maintenance-mode` channel at the top of your channel list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Method #2: **LockBot Simple V1 & Community V1**
Since you have already been in the `m-mode` state and the server is locked, you can unlock the whole server if you don't mind people seeing any of the staff channels by:

> Run the command `.m-unlock` to unlock your whole server

> To relock the Normal Information Category:
-  Right click the Information Category
- Go to Edit Category
- Permissions
- Scroll to the `@everyone` role and Deny the Send Messages permissions

> To relock the Logs Category
-  Right click the Server Logs Category
- Go to Edit Category
- Permissions
- Scroll to the `@everyone` role and Deny the Send Messages permissions

> To relock the Staff Channels Category
-  Right click the Staff Channels Category
- Go to Edit Category
- Permissions
- Scroll to the `@everyone` role and deny the Read Text Channels and See Voice Channels permission.



### Method #2: **LockBot Simple Support V1 Only**
The LockBot Simple Support server template is meant to make your life easy, you can have a support server and lock it down when needed without the hassle of having to mess up your permissions! In these instructions, you only have to do 1 thing while unlocking your server.

> Run the command `.m-unlock` to unlock your whole server

> To relock the Staff Communications Category
- Right click the Staff Communications Category
- Go to Edit Category
- Permissions
- Scroll to the `@everyone` role and deny the Read Text Channels and See Voice Channels permission.
